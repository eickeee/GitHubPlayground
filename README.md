# GitHubPlayground

This Android application can be seen as a little playground app that allows the user to search for GitHub users and display their repositories.

It furthermore demonstrates the usage of some modern Material Design components along with some common Java/Android libraries such as:

* Dagger2 (http://google.github.io/dagger)
* Retrofit (http://square.github.io/retrofit)
* Picasso (http://square.github.io/picasso)
* Butterknife (http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife)
* LeakCanary (https://github.com/square/leakcanary)
* Parceler (https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler)

TODOs
-------
* Introduce some use cases that leverage RxJava and RxAndroid
